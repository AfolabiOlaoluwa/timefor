TimeFor
========

[TimeFor](http://www.timefor.io/) lets you schedule phone call reminders to anyone in the United States. It's designed specifically for caretakers and anyone with a loved one who may need to be reminded of things now and then. We know that not everyone is glued to a mobile phone, and a landline may still be the best way to get ahold of some people, so TimeFor works for any phone.

This web app requires the companion app [summit_timefor](https://github.com/gilomen2/summit_timefor), which runs the telephony portion of the app on ShoreTel's Summit Platform.
